          <p>Truly great, next generation solutions come from the right mix of technical expertise, design savvy, and customer service through technical support. This is what I bring to your organization: education and practice in both web and app development, as well on the job experience solving technical problems. </p><p>I&#39;ve seen first hand that the difference between a good product or service and a great one is how well it fits the people who use it. That requires not just solutions that are powerful, but ones that fit into the wider cultural context of its audience. While it is impossible to design something perfectly, any deficiencies there can be made up for with the right customer service.</p><p>With a background that connects skill and office experience with broad human knowledge, I can provide your company and your customers with solutions that exceed expectations. </p>

            <li>On the job use of Microsoft Office, including Access and Outlook</li>
            <li>I have completed classes and launched projects involving:
              <ul>
                <li>Languages: Javascript, PHP, Python, C++</li>
                <li>HTML 5, CSS, and the Bootstrap template system</li>
                <li>CMSs: Wordpress, Joomla!, Movable Type</li>

          <h2 id="experience-highlights">Experience highlights</h2>
          <p>My most recent job experience is in a high volume call center for a pool supply company, where I handled technical support. I exceeded expectations for both call quality and call time by learning methods of explaining the more esoteric, yet still important aspects of taking care of pools to customers without expertise in this area. Our customers were mostly residential, but I also got experience helping commercial clients. </p><p>I am enrolled in the computer information systems program at College of DuPage, a world-class technical college with a focus on practical, on-the-job skills. My focus is software development. </p><p>I also have a experience in liberal arts subjects. It is my goal to combine a wide background of knowledge with technical expertise. This is a proven combination for success, as seen in companies like Basecamp, Wolfram, and Apple.</p>
